them these are fixed.

254bde40-fac6-41d7-aab3-7576b2dc6575
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.378
Yes, they are all part of the kernel.

2c9ed4ba-f811-4b90-98d5-41714c3da635
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.578
The implementation is part of the kernel,

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.160
but if you want to use them as a signal

cc9fe74f-c5dd-4409-ae2e-667c4c6a9802

we said we have a system called kill.

fd891c17-09b5-4dd4-9012-dd02cdfea19b
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.058
Uh, so basically you put the PID of the

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.090
Or the number of the signal.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.930
You can say that,

61fb055e-8878-43ec-afd7-07044e1590da
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.230
for instance the signal #5,

cca701b0-a137-4aa3-a433-92adb63dcaeb
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.398
but usually remembering the

e9218d3d-5efd-4adc-b053-bb37ff0b73c7
00:05:21.398 --> 00:05:23.024
numbers are difficult.

4a47d258-617e-4e9c-8e8d-23607ceff850
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.118
Usually use the constant

c45a811a-1227-46e6-bdf7-f38fc869a5fd
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.425

communication normal communication?

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.039
So let's back to review how a parent can

a3b18dec-0eee-419e-a4bd-9d76fc3bc906
00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:36.180
create a child and then start from there.

NOTE Confidence: 0.80458754

0344a09c-fb6d-4e8b-9caa-549b2e607f6f
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.798
This is the generation model

3f344e14-1b57-48aa-b2bf-6536c9cc4e1f
00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:40.918
one we already discussed this.

46aa7728-2779-4d66-968e-e0c6bd2500d5
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.168
 Basically the pattern does the fork check

0fffaeaa-109b-4992-a6a7-531808db3723
00:06:44.168 --> 00:06:47.875
the return PID if it is greater than zero,

NOTE Confidence: 0.80458754

1b0a893e-db84-4142-83fc-320c65fda2b8
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.212
it means that it's a parent else,

38cd91cd-1122-422a-8aba-8b1d545c8f29
00:06:50.212 --> 00:06:53.306
meaning that the child PID is zero.

30d5a0c7-c79e-4c23-8306-a868d2bc83d3
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.450

4325513d-c3da-4a87-acb7-443ebfe37977
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.149
So that is reachable by the child at runtime.

2ecf3570-2c2f-4df2-9e0b-8e4e5ab5ec3c
00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.520
So the parent, although have this

c3abb355-fa8d-40ab-a346-78088331565c

we put that ask about the pants here and

00:07:26.971 --> 00:07:29.291
one of the most important task of the

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.904
And at runtime we already know that we

00:07:42.904 --> 00:07:47.480

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.756
So the most immediate solution to this

9ed3a5c3-bec6-4fe6-ae9d-cd65312694fa
00:08:59.756 --> 00:09:03.971
problem is using a third party or a third

media as a location for communication.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.666
So the first way of communication is using

caaeeafa-3816-40b1-8c2e-a53dba12d106
00:09:10.666 --> 00:09:13.921
a single file and we already said that

365123f8-c41a-45d8-8445-45784d7afbdd
00:09:13.921 --> 00:09:16.814
whenever we save file in the same time,

f3464026-e429-424a-8b10-fbe7f7e7b9bd
00:09:16.814 --> 00:09:18.770
we may mean device because in

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.129
the file system part of the Unix.

c88561d5-8b3e-4ca2-baa1-366eaadf7962
00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:22.670
Anything is a device.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.980
Any device is a file treated

 as a device as it file.

a1704ef9-aedf-4646-b2c4-6a63dba68499
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.816
So you can choose a device.

d4b6cb66-3f0b-43be-afeb-65cf975f6bc6
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.290

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.740
terminal device or whatever device

090b51fe-b8d5-4960-85b3-8d8bd30fa9dd
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.182
Another way is that one of

00:09:41.182 --> 00:09:42.490
the devices are memory,

4ad4dffb-46e3-49dc-8112-9ff7f08ea624
00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:44.625
but we said that memory is a

special device usually handled

00:09:45.929 --> 00:09:47.879
by another part of the kernel.

e62fd7be-d6b5-4438-86f3-93db01b3f16f
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.678
But again,

ba44c1e1-ca00-4e46-a20d-c967ad5a0d73
00:09:48.678 --> 00:09:51.072
you can't use another part of

e339f3f5-ccc2-4a25-bc3c-4b700546b449
00:09:51.072 --> 00:09:53.545
the memory as a shared space

ca392ea1-1d96-40e0-8bce-9a0d22843e80
00:09:53.545 --> 00:09:55.939
between the child and the parent.

7252c649-1bd7-4956-bff4-97dde4597ab9
00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.694
So in both case you'll have

b105d4a1-7104-4aca-ae8c-bf967d122de9
00:09:58.694 --> 00:10:00.530

else or in a file or a device.

df9affe4-15ac-4ab9-9ce3-05f3c0d46106
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:10.460

I leave the memory for you

00:10:14.149 --> 00:10:16.570
as a research topic,

2904e4aa-d497-4697-a14f-b32ad022d7c9
00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:18.340
but we usually use the file

88b49dfd-0008-414b-859b-1dc6769fba62
00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.610
as a means of communication.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.210
So how this is possible?

NOTE Confidence: 0.911010624

636cf229-7456-4eb3-9808-f74426a77133
00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:29.650
Uh, basically. Inside the parents,

NOTE Confidence: 0.911010624

d58b3fca-1682-46b4-9031-7c3c2e44f9a7
00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:32.050
 before doing the fork. 

NOTE Confidence: 0.911010624

19d39e55-c2c8-455e-8519-f639da0c2c65
00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:34.745
We can have some lines of code

NOTE Confidence: 0.911010624

8023c09a-656d-4211-b9dc-763c1d27e876
00:10:34.745 --> 00:10:37.759
to share a file or to share

5d4e5df1-0dca-4824-b8f2-99a709c2075e
00:10:37.759 --> 00:10:40.405
the file descriptor to a file.

NOTE Confidence: 0.911010624

c1344750-a770-4910-8311-fdc3b94ddc0b
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.706
 So and then when we do the fork, 

NOTE Confidence: 0.911010624

8de8a1f5-8606-4a9a-bdbc-c02e9ed35483
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.761
we know that the exact copy of the same

78bc94e8-f5de-45f7-abaf-c09ea0b2457c
00:10:46.761 --> 00:10:49.975
lines going to be in the path in the chart.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.780
So as a result, the child has the

aa43984e-caee-4ee6-82e1-e6cefc98bde5
00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.560
file descriptor the same file,

695a7596-5ab7-4d0d-9cc2-dfe72f1cbd56
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.124
or at least knows the name of the file.

7c82ec9c-0b16-4d61-8a28-e941a036ba6f
00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:01.270
So if child can open or write or read from

NOTE Confidence: 0.911010624

cdde31ac-7c6a-41c5-930d-89d2928663e4
00:11:01.345 --> 00:11:04.558
the same file that is shaped by the parent.

ccf94973-7b29-49d6-bc54-564f836fec0f
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.180
So both of them knows to what file they have

00:11:09.288 --> 00:11:13.482

e44fd372-0c34-4d83-9abb-3bef63509009
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.500
Inside the child part of the code,

6597a80f-d15e-49bd-97a1-4e24b8c652d5
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.188
the child uses the filename to

09bfadce-bf2b-4ee8-a1e3-dc57a565314a
00:11:19.188 --> 00:11:21.830
open it and write into it,

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.602
or use the file descriptor to write to it.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:28.481
So at the child part we can

6f393fe4-97bb-4f6a-8692-cafbc7b22d38
00:11:28.481 --> 00:11:30.980
write to the file.

c35691b4-6a79-4b1e-9e47-51657bd4cee2
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.982
Inside the pan part of the code we

00:11:34.982 --> 00:11:37.586
can use the same filename to open

00:11:37.586 --> 00:11:41.068

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.488

00:11:49.182 --> 00:11:51.950
if the child wants to pass some information

00:11:52.022 --> 00:11:54.047
or communicate with the parent,

cb1447f2-ce27-463c-9f01-4c09504ed852
00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:57.180
the child provides the information

cbe19850-976f-43ad-b51e-70200beaa0f9
00:12:06.644 --> 00:12:09.932
the parent opens the file and read

00:12:14.523 --> 00:12:17.654
this is a shared space used by the

the child can open that the same file,

There is no need for opening for the child,

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.466
not the child.

00:34:00.466 --> 00:34:03.420

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.820

is not for the child,

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.445
So it doesn't belong to the child.

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.033
So if you can run this program

ada8c2c2-24ff-4b8f-bf88-2da253ce00ab
00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:28.734
So basically the X,

because we want the user to input the

In the final exam, and I ask you

0bc28d53-8135-4958-a635-6ede8b47279a
01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:36.290
what is the problem with this code?

01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:38.630
So you don't write the code,

01:25:38.630 --> 01:25:40.610
but you have the code,

01:25:40.610 --> 01:25:44.000
but you have to find a problem with the code.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.210
Or with the logic of the code, yeah?

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:55.502
I mean this this program so as I said,

078e25fb-aa2a-4300-a1cd-df6c564adee3
01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:57.430
if you run this program

01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:58.966
it doesn't work properly.

01:25:58.970 --> 01:26:00.804
So if you look at the code,

01:26:00.810 --> 01:26:03.210
you have to try to find what is the problem,
